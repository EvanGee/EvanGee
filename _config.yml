  As the first software engineer at Wyvern, I had the opportunity to design and integrate the CI/CD pipeline, web technologies and 
  frameworks, custom ETL pipelines, and cloud infrastructure. My software allowed us to qualify for an NRC IRAP grant which financed the 
  software development for 2 years.  I was able to gain a lot of experience in a short amount of time, using industry standard tools like Git, Terraform, ARGO (kubernetes), AWS ECS, and much more. I am proficient in Python, Javascript, 
  Typescript, React, React-native, Golang, Java, and C for development purposes. In addition to development, I was able to help create a culture of learning, 
  kindness, and growth at Wyvern.

  At Meta, I work on their AI hardware team, specifically RISCV AISCs (application specific integrated circuits).
  I am fortunate to be able to work with some of the most talented engineers in the world. My favourite memory is working with the ASIC team
  In Silicon Valley during a 'bringup', when the global team was all together working to verify the quality of the newly manufactured chips. My
  contributions allowed us to scale the debug code to multiple projects, and my tools dramatically reduced our team's time spent on debugging our code.

          I currently work at Meta on their AI Hardware. I primarily work on their RISCV debug subsystem components. I work
          closely with our suppliers and engineers to verify that our debug subsystem is working correctly. I also work
          on developing tools like GDB integrations, performance visualizations and various related tools.

        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          I worked with a startup to help them design and implement a demo app for them to raise funding. The process involves working with the founder 
          to understand their vision, and then translating that into a software design that can be implemented by a team of developers. We use Figma for the design, and
          React for the front-end, Django for the back-end, and Terraform for the infrastructure.

          Designing and integrating order automation, orbit prediction, scalable cloud solutions, and internal web applications.
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          I was the first software employee on the team. They relied on me to figure out when and where to take photos from space, and construct a scalable, secure, extensible software stack
          that can be used to process customer orders and task our now 3 active satellites in commercial operations. My main contributions were:
            - Designing and implementing an event driven architecture using Golang and Kafka that allows for easy integration of new microservices. 
            This gave the team a framework for building microservices, which saved time and mental energy when implementing services. 
            - Building an orbital prediction microservice using open source technology, which was much cheaper than the industry leading software (which costs around 80k/year). 
            - Building a satellite tasking application using React and Django that we use internally to schedule our commercial satellite assets.
            - Developing the software portion of our remote space sensing license application (RSSSA) to ensure that our software was compliant 
            with government security standards.

          In my role as an escalation engineer at Dell, I specialized in diagnosing bugs within product firmware. 
          Drawing on my expertise in storage area networks, I provided crucial support to customers encountering unexpected 
          issues with Dell products. I developed diagnostic scripts to efficiently identify and resolve complex bugs. 
          Additionally, I assisted Dell's customer service team in resolving intricate product-related issues, effectively 
          saving both time and money.

  - title: A Little More About Me
    layout: text
    content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
      I'm newly married, and looking forward to starting a family soon!

      Alongside my interests in networks and software engineering some of my other interests and hobbies are:
      - I love trying to save people money, and I have a passion for financial literacy. I track all my own spending habits with a monthly budget.
      - I love economics and banking. I use graphana to congregate and track specific financial market and interest rate data.
      - I attend a weekly small book club, and a weekly investment club. 
      
      Here is my home made, fully automated, High Pressure Aeroponics setup in my house. It uses 95% less water usuage and 60% less fertilizer than traditional hydroponics.
