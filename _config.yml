  *programmer joke: __!false__, it’s funny because it’s true.*

  As the first software engineer at Wyvern, I had the opportunity to design and integrate the CI/CD pipeline, web technologies and 
  frameworks, custom ETL pipelines, and cloud infrastructure. My software allowed us to qualify for an NRC IRAP grant which financed the 
  software development for 2 years.  I was able to gain a lot of experience in a short amount of time, using industry standard tools like Git, Terraform, ARGO (kubernetes), AWS ECS, and much more. I am proficient in Python, Javascript, 
  Typescript, React, React-native, Golang, Java, and C for development purposes. In addition to development, I was able to help create a culture of learning, 
  kindness, and growth at Wyvern.
  
  At University I was one of the founders and the vice president of the MacEwan computer science club. As vice president, I helped
  students engage in computer science through teaching, club activities, and organizing events.
  A favorite memory of mine is teaching a fellow student about HEX (base 16), and having it finally click for them.
  My contribution raised the club membership from around 10 to over 100 people in a couple months.
  Today, the club still exists and has grown to thousands of computer science students and Alumni.

        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          I am currently working with a startup to help them design and implement a demo app for them to raise funding. The process involves working with the founder 
          to understand their vision, and then translating that into a software design that can be implemented by a team of developers. We use Figma for the design, and
          React for the front-end, Django for the back-end, and Terraform for the infrastructure.

          Designing and integrating order automation, orbit prediction, scalable cloud solutions, and internal web applications.
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          I was the seventh employee and first software person on the team. They relied on me to figure out when and where to take photos from space, and construct a scalable, secure, extensible software stack
          that can be used to process customer orders and task our now 3 active satellites in commercial operations. My main contributions were:
            - Designing and implementing an event driven architecture using Golang and Kafka that allows for easy integration of new microservices. 
            This gave the team a framework for building microservices, which saved time and mental energy when implementing services. 
            - Building an orbital prediction microservice using open source technology, which was much cheaper than the industry leading software (which costs around 80k/year). 
            - Building a satellite tasking application using React and Django that we use internally to schedule our commercial satellite assets.
            - Developing the software portion of our remote space sensing license application (RSSSA) to ensure that our software was compliant 
            with government security standards.

          In my role as an escalation engineer at Dell, I specialized in diagnosing bugs within product firmware. 
          Drawing on my expertise in storage area networks, I provided crucial support to customers encountering unexpected 
          issues with Dell products. I developed diagnostic scripts to efficiently identify and resolve complex bugs. 
          Additionally, I assisted Dell's customer service team in resolving intricate product-related issues, effectively 
          saving both time and money.

  - title: A Little More About Me

    content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
      Alongside my interests in networks and software engineering some of my other interests and hobbies are:
      - I love trying to save people money, and I have a passion for financial literacy. I track all my own spending habits with a monthly budget.
      - I love economics and banking. I use graphana to congregate and track specific financial market and interest rate data.
      - I attend a weekly small group book club, and a weekly investment club.
      - Getting more involved in the edmonton dev community. I've been attending meetups, but want to try and present at one soon.
      
      Here is my home made, fully automated, High Pressure Aeroponics setup in my house. It uses 95% less water usuage and 60% less fertilizer than traditional hydroponics.
