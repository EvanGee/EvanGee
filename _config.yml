  *programmer joke: __!false__, it’s funny because it’s true.*

  At university I was one of the founders and vice president of the MacEwan computer science club. As vice president, I helped 
  students get engaged in computer science, raising the club membership from around 10 to over 100 people in a couple months. My
  involvement encouraged other club members to put in 100% effort, and together we organized many talks and events. 
  Today, the club still exists and has grown with thousands of computer science students and Alumni. 

  Volunteering at the University of Alberta I helped build a satellite. In addition to writing and integrating a file transfer protocol (in C), 
  I helped design and integrate drivers, design software, and analyze potential open-source alternatives. My work helped the software team 
  achieve their goals of building an open-source satellite platform. This satellite is currently in space! 

  As a member of Google ignite (google), I designed lessons for high school students, teaching them about computer networking. The students
  got to build and deploy their own websites.

          I was the seventh employee, and first software person on the team. I designed and built the first draft of their software. 
          They rely on me to figure out when and where to take photo's from space, and construct a scalable, secure, extensible software stack
          that can take customer orders and task our satellites. My software has helped secure grant funding of over 1 million dollars, and is currently being used
          to task our first Satellite.
