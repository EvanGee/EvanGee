  *programmer joke: __!false__, it’s funny because it’s true.*

  At University I was one of the founders and the vice president of the MacEwan computer science club. As vice president, I helped 
  students engage in computer science, raising the club membership from around 10 to over 100 people in a couple months. The club
  and I organized many talks and events. Today, the club still exists and has grown to thousands of computer science students and Alumni.

  Volunteering at the University of Alberta I helped build a satellite. In addition to writing and integrating a file transfer protocol (in C),
  I helped design and integrate drivers, design software, and analyze potential open-source alternatives. My work helped the software team
  achieve its goals of building an open-source satellite platform. This satellite is currently in space! https://albertasat.ca/ex-alta-2/

  As a member of Google ignite (google), I designed lessons for high school students, teaching them about computer networking. The students
  got to build and deploy their own websites.

          I was the seventh employee and first software person on the team.
          They rely on me to figure out when and where to take photo's from space, and construct a scalable, secure, extensible software stack
          that can take customer orders and task our now 3 active satellites. My software has helped secure grant funding of over 1 million dollars, 
          and is currently being used to task our first 3 Satellites.

          As a software engineer (U.S) I helped to diagnose bugs in Dell's product firmware. Dell relied on my knowledge of storage area networks
          to provide support to customers who have unforeseen issues with their products. I helped saved banks and other large customers millions
          of dollars from data center outages.

          As a contractor, I helped deliver value to their organization by reducing costs. This app
          reduces the time employees need to label and download images for portfolios by approximately 20 minutes a day.

      Alongside my interests in networks and software engineering some of my other interests and hobbies are:
      - Automated Gardening + Farming.
      - Tax structures.
      - AI.
      - Economics, securities, and banking.
      - Building apps.
      - Genuienly my job is my hobby. I love to code and build things.

      Here is my home made High Pressure Aeroponics setup in my house. It uses 95% less water usuage than traditional hydroponics and 60% less fertilizer.
